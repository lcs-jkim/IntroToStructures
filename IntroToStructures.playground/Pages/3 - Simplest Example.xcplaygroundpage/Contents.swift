 A structure could be used to tie together the x and y values of a point on a Cartesian plane.
 
 This would make the definition of the function to find the distance a bit clearer to write.
 
 In turn, the function becomes clearer to use.
 
 Have a look:

// Define a structure that represents a point on a Cartesian plane
// An initializer is automatically created for a structure like this
struct Point {

// Define a couple of points (notice the parameters to initialize a point are provided automatically
let firstPoint = Point(x: 3, y: 0)
let secondPoint = Point(x: 0, y: 4)

// Now define an alternate version of the distance function
func distance(from: Point, to: Point) -> Double {
    
    return sqrt(pow(to.x - from.x, 2) + pow(to.y - from.y, 2))
